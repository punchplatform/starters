# Java Punchline

Java punchlines leverage a lightweight single process java runtime.
The punchline shown here is the simplest example, a generator source 
generates some data, followed by a print function.

Try 

```sh
make run
```
or 
```sh
make help
```

Punchlines are frequently used with punchlets. To be familiar with punchlets, check the [punchlets](../../punchlets) guide.
